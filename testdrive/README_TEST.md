## Edit a Test case 

Open the ZTTDOGWS.cbl file under test → data folder

<img src='../images/devx/devx7.png' width='65%'>

Go to line number 196.      
Change the value from 9 to 900.      
Reference screenshot: 

<img src='../images/devx/devx8.png' width='65%'>

From the command line, run the “t4z” command.     
Reference screenshot:

<img src='../images/devx/devx10.png' width='65%'>

You will observe that the test run is a failure. Expected Record count is 9 whereas we edited the value to be 900.

## Add statements to Test File

Open the ZTTDOGWS.cbl file under test → data folder

Go to line 51 (Be under the PROCEDURE DIVISION section). Reference Screenshot: 

<img src='../images/devx/devx11.png' width='65%'>

Move the cursor to column 12.       
Type "t4z me".      
Note: It will start filling out the intellisense.      
Select “t4z Message write”.
