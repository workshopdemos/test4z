## Test4z Workshop - Tutorial and Exercise

For many developers, testing is viewed as a necessary but time-consuming task. Why is that? It's because testing COBOL applications often involves numerous manual steps or setting up complex input data scenarios. Test4z challenges the notion that high-quality testing is inherently time-consuming by offering a solution that accelerates the development process.

For this exercise, you'll follow these top-level steps:

* Part 1: Write/verify unit test using the recording (mock API)
* Part 2: Add validation logic to the unit test (spy API)
* Part 3: Add pass/fail checks to the unit test (assert API)
* Part 4: Run final test (optionally make it fail).

### Getting started

To complete this exercise, you have two options:

1. Detailed step-by-step instructions in the [Test4z Tutorial - Exercise](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z/blob/main/docs/Test4z-Workshop.pdf) (PDF)
2. A short ["code along"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hFXFf17kEI) video on YouTube (13 minutes).

If you would like a short introduction to Test4z, check out the [Test4z Tutorial - Primer](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z/blob/main/docs/Test4z-Primer.pdf) (PDF).

### Installation steps

Follow these steps to copy the exercise source files:
1. Clone the [workshopdemos/test4z](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z) repository (or select _Code &gt; Download ZIP_)
2. In Visual Studio Code, open a new window on the `workshop` folder (_File &gt; New Window_ followed by _File &gt; Open Folder..._)
3. If you have already installed Test4z, replace these files with your own local versions:

  - `test4z.project.config.json`
  - `test4z.user.config.json`
  - `.vscode/settings.json`

  If you have not installed and configured Test4z before, delete the above files from the cloned repository folder. Refer to these steps:

  1. [Install](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-mainframe-software/devops/test4z/1-0/installing/install-test4z-command-line-interface.html) the Test4z command line interface
  2. Initialize the Visual Studio Code extension (`t4z install-vscode-extensions`)
  3. Configure the VS Code environment (`t4z init`).

  The Test4z installation command `t4z init` regenerates the configuration
  files above based on your responses (host name, user name, HLQ, etc.).

### Test4z configuration

The `t4z init` command will prompt for all the necessary fields to run Test4z. Below is brief summary of the fields in `test4z.user.config.json`:

* `sdkHome` = [same value as `home` field from `t4z home` command]
* `hostname` = your host URL or IP address for USS
* `sshPort` = SSH port, default is 22
* `user` = your host login ID
* `sshKeyFile` = your public SSH key file located in .ssh directory
* `zosWorkspacePath` = USS directory,  e.g., `/z/your-login-id/workshop`
* `testHlq` = TSO data set, e.g., `your-login-id.WORKSHOP`
* `zosCodePage` = code page, default is 1140
* `test4zRuntimeHlq` = null (or HLQ of data set containing installed Test4z runtime)

For the workshop, the field values for `test4z.project.config.json` do not need to be updated.
